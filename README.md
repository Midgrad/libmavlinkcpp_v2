# libmavlinkcpp_v2

Autogenerated cpp11 headers from https://github.com/Midgrad/mavlink.  
Solely based on the original mavlink repo.  

This repo solves two problems:
- Lack or proper mavlink versioning and unexpected changes of autogenerated C repos - https://github.com/mavlink/c_library_v2  
- Lack of autogenerated cpp11 repos.
